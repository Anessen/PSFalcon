# Command List
After importing the module you can view the list of commands provided with PSFalcon:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module PSFalcon
```

# Command-based Help

Because PSFalcon uses dynamic parameters, the traditional PowerShell `Get-Help` command doesn't show parameters that can be used with PSFalcon commands. Instead, use `<command> -Help` to call a custom function that displays information about the available parameters and a basic description of their use.

# Positional Parameters

Most PSFalcon commands have positional parameters (listed when using -Help), which means that you are able to omit the parameter name when running a command. However, this only works if youâ€™re using sequential parameters.

For instance, Invoke-FalconRTR works as expected in this example because `-BaseCommand` (position 1), `-Arguments` (position 2) and `-HostIds` (position 3) are all defined:
```powershell
Invoke-FalconRTR ls C:\Windows <id>, <id>
```

If `-Arguments` is _not_ included, this no longer works as PowerShell (or the API, depending on the context) thinks that `-HostIds` is supposed to be the value for `-Arguments`:

```powershell
Invoke-FalconRTR getsid <id>, <id>
```

# Common PSFalcon Parameters

## All
The `-All` switch reads the pagination information in an API response and repeats requests to that API until all the available results are retrieved. Using this parameter allows you to ignore the `offset` and `after` fields and have PSFalcon handle the gathering of additional results.

However, it is important to note that the CrowdStrike APIs were not designed to "retrieve all data". If you exceed the maximum limit of a particular API, it is best to modify your command using the `-Filter` parameter to ensure that your next attempts will succeed. Using a filter will allow you to break your results into smaller groups and use those groups to retrieve all the available results.

## Detailed
If a PSFalcon command returns "identifiers", you can use the `-Detailed` switch to pass the identifiers back to the command and retrieve more detailed information. For example, running `Get-FalconHost` will retrieve host identifiers, but using `Get-FalconHost -Detailed` is the same as running two commands (which outputs the identifiers, plus information about the hosts).

```powershell
$Ids = Get-FalconHost
Get-FalconHost -Ids $ids
```

The `-Detailed` parameter will also break up the secondary command into appropriately sized groups, avoiding errors when retrieving details about large numbers of identifiers.

## Common PowerShell parameters

Each command was written as an [advanced function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_advanced?view=powershell-7) which enables support for common PowerShell parameters, including:
* -Verbose: Provides more explicit information during a request
* -Debug: Displays the raw JSON content of a request and a response

Using either of these parameters can help you understand the work PSFalcon does behind the scenes to properly format your requests and the responses.

## Filtering and the Falcon Query Language

Many PSFalcon commands support the use of [Falcon Query Language](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/45/falcon-query-language-fql) \("FQL"\) statements using the -Filter parameter. However, it is important to keep in mind:

* Available FQL filters will vary between APIs, and are not determined by PSFalcon
* Each FQL filter and value may be case-sensitive

Values in an FQL statement tend to either be restricted to _null_, _$true_, _$false_, an _integer_ or a _string_ (description, date or time, etc). 

The simplest FQL statements require a single condition and value. For instance, to find the host identifier for a device with the hostname `ONE`, use the following filter:

```powershell
Get-FalconHost -Filter "hostname:'ONE'"
```

Additional conditions and values can be added using the proper [operator](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/45/falcon-query-language-fql#Operators). The following filter example will retrieve the host identifier for a device that has a hostname of `ONE` and is running Windows:

```powershell
Get-FalconHost -Filter "hostname:'ONE'+platform_name:'Windows'"
```

To find host identifiers for devices that are named `ONE` or `TWO`:

```powershell
Get-FalconHost -Filter "hostname:'ONE',hostname:'TWO'"
```

Multiple conditions can be used to retrieve more complex results. The following filter lists host identifiers for devices that are named `ONE` and are running Windows or are not named `TWO` and have been seen online within the last two days:

```powershell
Get-FalconHost -Filter "(hostname:'ONE'+platform_name:'Windows'),(hostname:!'TWO'+last_seen:>'Last 2 days')"
```

**NOTE**: 'Last 2 days' is not a valid FQL value when submitted via API. PSFalcon looks for a relative date string like `last <integer> hour(s)/day(s)` and automatically converts it into an RFC3339 date string \(UTC\).

For example, at exactly 14:00 hours \(Pacific Standard Time\) on November 10, 2020 if you attempted to use `Get-FalconHost` with the following filter:

```powershell
Get-FalconHost -Filter "last_seen:>'Last 2 days'" -Verbose
```

PSFalcon converts your filter to the following value \(seen through the use of the `-Verbose` parameter\):

```powershell
VERBOSE: [Get-Query] filter=last_seen:>'2020-11-10T22:00:00.0000000Z'
```
